# Invoking the Interpreter

To start using Python, you'll need to invoke the Python interpreter. On Unix systems, you can typically find it at `/usr/local/bin/python3.12`. Simply type `python3.12` into your terminal to start the interpreter.

On Windows machines where Python is installed from the Microsoft Store, you can use the `python3.12` command. If you have the `py.exe` launcher installed, you can use the `py` command.

### Exiting the Interpreter

To exit the Python interpreter, you can type `quit()` or use an end-of-file character (`Control-D` on Unix, `Control-Z` on Windows).

### Interactive Editing

The Python interpreter supports interactive editing, history substitution, and code completion on systems that support the GNU Readline library. You can test if command line editing is supported by typing `Control-P`. If it beeps, you have command line editing.

### Running Scripts

You can also run Python scripts by passing the script name as an argument to the Python interpreter. For example: `python script.py`. 

If you want to run a one-liner command, you can use `python -c "command"`.

### Running Modules

Some Python modules can be run as scripts by using the `-m` flag followed by the module name. For example: `python -m module_name`.

### Interactive Mode After Script Execution

If you want to run a script and then enter interactive mode, you can pass the `-i` flag before the script name.

### Additional Options

For more command line options, you can refer to the documentation on command line and environment options.
