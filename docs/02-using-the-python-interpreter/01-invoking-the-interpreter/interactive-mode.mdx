### Interactive Mode in Python

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

In Python, interactive mode allows you to interactively enter and execute commands directly into the interpreter. When you enter commands from a terminal, Python prompts you with the primary prompt `>>>` to enter a command. If a command spans multiple lines, Python uses the secondary prompt `...` for continuation lines.

Here's what you'll typically see when entering interactive mode:

```
$ python3.12
Python 3.12 (default, April 4 2022, 09:25:04)
[GCC 10.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

In this mode, you can enter Python expressions and statements directly, and Python will execute them immediately.

For example:

```python
>>> the_world_is_flat = True

>>> if the_world_is_flat:
...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
...
Be careful not to fall off!
```

Here, we've entered a multi-line `if` statement, and Python executed it line by line, printing the result.

Interactive mode is useful for quickly testing code snippets, experimenting with language features, and debugging. It provides immediate feedback and allows you to iterate rapidly.

For more information on interactive mode and its features, you can refer to the <Link to="/docs/category/appendix">Interactive mode</Link> section of the documentation.
